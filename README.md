# eft
Elon Freedom token, or EFT, is a token that aims to be a community driven
token capable of disrupting social media through an incentivized series of token
burns and staking rewards. EFT is a community driven token that aims to empower
its users to inject their collective ideas into the discourse of social media
platforms. EFT aims to disrupt these platforms dominated by corporations
influencing the general discourse as well as individuals acting as their own agents
in self interest to create a community that will act together on their own interests,
creating a voice that is amplified. For this to happen, EFT recognizes the structure
of which social media platforms are based is one in which engagement is crucial
for their success, whether that be by posting content or interacting with content, to
name just a few. Leveraging this engagement is the key to EFT and democratizing
the social aspect of social media. This is what we term Incentivized Participation.
